      <h1>Shaya Ishaq <sup>Creative Director</sup></h1>

    
    <p>Shaya Ishaq is an interdisciplinary artist, designer, and writer currently based in Ottawa. In her practice, she delves into themes related to contemporary craft discourse, design anthropology, (afro)futurism and diaspora. As a first-generation Kenyan-Ugandan connected to a lineage of weavers, she is devoted to the materiality and the creolization of form.</p>

    <p>Shaya is often called to textiles and clay as a starting point to create wearable art, jewelry adornments, and installations that incite participatory engagement. Through the meditative processes of weaving, felting, and handmade ceramics, she explores the nuances of her positionality and the liminality of rites of passage which often leads to sculptural textile and ceramic works. Her curiosity about the poetics and politics of space informs her interests in creating immersive environments that embrace the emergent possibilities of spatial design. This allows her to explore how we relate and hold space for each other in space across differences.</p>

    <p>Shaya has studied at Concordia University with a focus on Fibres & Material Practices, NSCAD University as well as Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, Maine. Shaya has been a research fellow of the Textiles and Materiality Research Cluster as part of the Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture, and Technology. </p>
